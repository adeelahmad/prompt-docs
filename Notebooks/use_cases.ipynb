This wine has deep, dark red/black hues, lifted aromas of mulberry, raspberry, coffee and kirsch. The bramble, chocolate, methol and rosemary fl avours that fi ll the mouth are present in abundance, with delicate, sensual and ripe tannins playing a structural role. This wine is ideally suited to good food, good friends and good conversation.\n",

Use of new oak was delicate, so the aromas are authentic Pinot Noir.  \n",

This wine dispalys the roundest tasting profile of all Gaja single-vineyard wines. The rich body, subtle texture and fine, ripe tannins are typical for this wine of great finesse, the quintessential expression of the land and the Nebbiolo grape. This wine has extraordinary aging potential--more than forty years in outstanding vintages.\n",

On the nose this wine exhibits blackberry jam, vanilla, andallspice leap out of the glass yet gracefully yield to notes of dried plum, coee bean, and perfume with some patience. Deceptively soft up front, with fresh strawberry and raspberry immediately apparent. These instantly give way though to density and concentration of flavor as the tannins and acidity come into focus. The finish is elegant and balanced with the aforementioned ripe flavors and textures of the vintage comingled with bright acid, cocoa, crème de menthe, and chalky minerality.\n",

Groth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon embodies the essence of the most remarkable winegrowing region in the Napa Valley. Or maybe the world.

While it was the third consecutive year marked by limited rainfall, the 2014 vintage offered a perfectly temperate growing season characterized by long, moderate days and cool, clear nights. The year began with warm spring conditions that gave way to an early bud break and the consistent, dry weather afforded an optimal fruit set of small berries with incredible concentration. Crop yields were down a bit from 2013, but the quality was magnificent. It was a textbook growing season, every winemaker’s dream.\n",
